Google Summer of Code Project with openSUSE (Still in Development )

To build a standalone Application/tool called Size Dog that can perform Automatic resizing of File system and Logical Volumes. This Application/Tool can be called by the package manager if the size of the package to be installed exceeds the size available on the logical volume and increase the size of the logical volume if there is unallocated space in the logical volume group.
